# Exercises
# 1. Look up variables from the 2020 decennial Census with `load_variables(2020, "pl")`.
# 2. Get a dataset with information on total population and the Hispanic population from the 2020 decennial Census for counties in Washington using appropriate Census variable IDs and `get_decennial()`. 
# 3. Bonus: try to adapt the code above to find out which county in Washington has the largest Hispanic share of its population in 2020.  We'll review after the break!
